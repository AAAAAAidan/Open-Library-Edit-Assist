# Open Library Edit Assist

Adds an input field and button to the add and edit pages of Open Library that allow you to retrieve book details from the Google Books API and import them into the edit fields. The data will be from the first result found, so be sure that the title or ISBN entered is exact. If values already exist in any of the the input fields, you will be asked if you want to change each one.
